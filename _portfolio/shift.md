title: "The Emergence of Modern Statistics as a Cognitive Shift– The Case of Poland
(1878-1931)"
excerpt: "Following Hacking (2016), the main goal of this project is to trace the mechanisms in
which emergence and proliferation of statistics shapes cognitive history (Dunér &
Ahlberger 2019). In order to do so, I discuss the case of late 19th/ early 20th century
statistics in Poland and defend two major claims. Firstly, I argue that theintroduction
of modern statistics with its quantitative concepts and tools (Stigler 2002) was a
major component in the project of Weberian modernization. This claim is of course
already present in the literature, but was so far mostly limited to well-developed
Western states, such as Great Britain (Crooke & O’Hara 2012) or Germany (Tooze
2001). This process is much less understood in the case of underdeveloped
countries and the instance of Poland serves as a nuanced complement to the
received view. I show that the mechanism in question happened more drastically on
the outskirts of the mainstream scientific network and was driven by different actors
(Latour 2007), as the scientific elites intentionally strived for the introduction of
statistical ideas to (in their minds) catch up in the modernization process. Secondly
(and more importantly), however, I argue that this process is best understood not as
a just social or political phenomenon, but a cognitive one. Specifically, the most
profound impact of the rapid proliferation of statistics was what I dub – following the
footsteps of Daston & Galison (2021) and Renn (2015)– a ‘shift in the standard of
rationality’. It denotes a major and relatively abrupt change in how quantitative
thinking became a major component of scientific knowledge-production and but also
its social impact and acceptance. In this case what starts as growing ‘trust in
numbers’ (Porter 1996) becomes more akin to a genuine epistemic rupture
(Bachelard 1986). At the crux of that issue lies the torrential introduction of numbers
(Crook & O’Hara 2012), datasets and metrics that quickly became an indispensable
tool for establishing both scientific and non-scientific facts in the public discourse,

but even more so – for convincing the adversaries. In rapidly modernizing Poland
this process quickly became so deeply rooted that social and economical arguments
were even sometimes labelled as ‘proofs’ or ‘calculations’ (Ostasiewicz 2012). In
order to examine this process that I call ‘convincing without convincing’ I analyze
three major public debates ranging in their timescale and subject matter: discussion
on ‘belatedness of Galicia’ (1888), the discourse on ‘social degeneration’ (1878) and
the ‘intellectualist conundrum’ (debate on the impact of education on morality of
1880s). These consequential events serve as exemplars of changes in what was
considered rationally-motivated at the time. This cognitive shift became fully visible
with the birth of the Second Polish Republic and its fully professional statistical
institutions (e.g. Socio-Economic Institute) and influential figures, such as Oskar
Lange, Michał Kalecki, or Ludwik Landau (Mazurek 2019).>"
