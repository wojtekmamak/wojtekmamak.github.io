title: "‘To Foresee and Forestall’: History of
Statistics in Sustainability Sciences."
excerpt: "Sustainability sciences are often said to be fundamentally organized around their ambition to
‘foresee and forestall’ (Schweitzer 1952; Grober 2012). In order to achieve that, they rely on
computational techniques – statistical modelling, simulations, multivariate measurements and
calculations, which not only shape knowledge-production but also mediate the circulation of
findings. Interestingly, this crucial aspect of sustainability research has been largely neglected in the
metascientific literature (including history of science), contrary to similar sciences, such as climate
science (Edwards 2011; 2013) or ecology (Anker 2011; 2012). Hence, the aim of this work package
(WP) is to fill in this gap by scrutinizing sustainability sciences research goals and experimental
practices through its quantitative lens. It will utilize methods of integrated history and philosophy of
science (Integrated HPS; Shan 2020) – in particular history of measurement and quantification
(Kula 1970; Desrosieres 2011, Porter 1986; 1992, Diaz-Bone & Didier 2016) – but supplemented
with tools from the digital humanities toolkit, such as simple NLP techniques and quantitative
history of concepts."
