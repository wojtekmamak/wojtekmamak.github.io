Cyberpunk Literature"

excerpt: 'Cyberpunk, on par of philosophy, as both try to analyze real
scientific discoveries and its possible outcomes, can be treated as a form of
thought experiments, creating technologically-enhanced imagined worlds to
question certain boundaries of traditional philosophical reflexion. On this ground,
there is an important assignment for philosophy and literature to set up and
enquire these possible worlds as a sort of mental laboratory for testing various
notions, ideas and experiments - both technological and philosophical with their
possible consequences. Philosophy and cyberpunk literature, while having
radically different aims, tools and techniques, share this feature and can
complement each other in the task of understanding modernity'
