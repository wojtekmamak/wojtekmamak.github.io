excerpt: 'Psychology, statistics, computer science, machine learning, 
philosophy and many other disciplines routinely use information-talk in regard to a 
whole array of both biological and artificial structures. Thus, it is generally 
uncontroversial to hold that regardless of the differences and peculiarities of given
 cognitive systems, they are all information-processors. However, surprisingly, the 
 notion itself (especially in the neural context) for long has escaped thorough 
 philosophical exploration, as the other core concepts, such as representation (e.g. 
 Chemero 2009, Ramsey 2007, Cummins 1996) or computation (Piccinini 2017, Fresco 2014) 
are frequently subject to. In order to do that I rely ideas from both information 
theory and philosophy, such as Daniel Wilkenfelds recent <<understanding-as-compression>> 
theory that frames compression-likes processes as maximizing scaffolding-to-output 
ratio. My aim is to show that the highly-structured nature of the informational 
makeup of the environment in which perception is performed (as demonstrated by the Natural 
Scence Statistics research program), it makes intuitive sense to think of perceptual 
processes as compression-like. Compression constitutes canonical, well-understood and 
elegantly formally defined information-processing (Shannon 1948, Chaitin 1977) 
which could help explain how the perceptual system generalizes and generates information. 
Later on I assess the potential objections about the inability of information-based 
explanations to account for representations. To dismiss them, I turn to the recent 
theories of the naturalization of informational content (Isaac 2019, Skyrms 2010). 
I argue that it opens up the possibility of comparing artificial and biological 
signalling systems in the virtue of representational similarity. I mobilize a host 
of empirical evidence from both experimental neuroscience and artificial neural systems 
in order to assess how well the latter might model or explain the former. 
I also investigate how structural representational similarities between different 
cognitive agents can be traced due to the relation of infomorphism.'
