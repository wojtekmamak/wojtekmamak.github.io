Hi, I’m Wojtek, a researcher and PhD 
candidate at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology, 
**Polish Academy of Sciences** in Warsaw, Poland. 
I am currently affiliated with the **Section for Logic and Cognitive Science** and **prof. Marcin Miłkowski’s research group**. 
I have graduated from College of Inter-Faculty Studies in the Humanities, 
University of Warsaw and hold two MA's – 
in philosophy (specialization: philosophy of mind) and history (esp. history of science), 
with distinction.

My research 
======

Philosophy in/of Cognitive Science
------

My research interests lay on the 
intersection of philosophy with 
cognitive science (especially 
neuroscience and psychology). 
I mostly interested in how 
philosophical ideas can play a 
crucial part in Cog Sci: both as a contributing
factor, using formal tools and models 
(thus: philosophy **in** Cog Sci), but 
also as a meta-level activity
(in a more classical philosophy 
**of** Cog Sci flavour). 
Following both these approaches, 
I focus on **philosophy of information** 
and **computational theories of mind**, respectively.

To get more exact, currently I am
mostly involved with investigating the
**scope and status of theories of 
information for explaining cognition** 
(both natural and artificial), which is a subject of my PhD dissertation. In the thesis, 
I combine developing novel ideas that build upon philosophical research concerning structural representations and semantic information with the epistemological assessments of explanatory power of information-based theories in cognitive science in general.

Previously, I have also done research on **cognitive penetrability of perception**, **compression-based accounts of representation** and **algorithmization in (AI) ethics**.
Open projects I keep working on include: the status of **representational format** in neuroscience and defining **generativity**.




History of Quantification
------


For the history of science side of things, I am quite bewitched with the omnipresence and deep **trust in numbers, stats and data** in pretty much all domains of life nowadays.
Hence, as a historian, I wish to understand how and why that happened. Following some historians, philosophers and sociologists of statistics (esp. Ted Porter and Ian Hacking), I call this process **‘quantification’**. 
My research is geared towards pinpointing both the causal mechanisms of this emergence and its ramifications. Naturally, I tend to focus a lot on the case of Polish history (mid-19th century onwards) within this big picture, which is quite a quirky (and as such – highly instructive) case in the grand scheme of history of stats. 

In particular, I want to argue for the shift in **‘standards of rationality’** brought about by this torrential flood of metrics and calculations – a central thesis of my longlasting (& ongoing) book-length project in the area. For this purpose – what is in essence a quest for Cognitive History of statistical thinking – I combine methods from history and philosophy of science, history of ideas and STS but also quantitative tools (irony is not lost on me here). You can perhaps now sense why I strongly believe that history and philosophy of science are not disconnected fields of study for me, but  strongly integrated ones (thus my investment in the Integrated HPS [history and philosophy of science] approach). 

Around the site
======
If you are interested in some of these problems, you are cordially invited to check the **‘Projects’** or **‘Publications’** bars for more detailed information. The former covers bigger projects that are well advanced, but still under construction, whilst the latter contains published texts or ones that are at least already in a readable form (drafts or manuscripts currently under review). 

You may also find slideshows of selected conference talks and lectures that I gave under the **‘Talks’** banner. Current languages available include English, Polish and... Mongolian! [section under construction, please consult the 'Talks' section in CV for a full list of presentations I gave]

Do not hesitate to get in touch via e-mail: wojciech.mamak@gmail.com (you can also use the bar on the left), if you have questions or are willing to collaborate!

Extracurriculars
======
When not busy doing history and philosophy of science 
(and that is quite a chunk of my time, admittedly), 
I consume an unholy amount of sports, chiefly soccer. 
Some years ago, American football also became a revelation. 
Apart from regular game-watching, I am particularly interested in the introduction of stats into sports (and their limitations).

Other things I enjoy include travelling, chess, 
literature (including video games), electronic music and memetics. 
I also care a lot about experimenting with food from around the globe 
(both as a producer and a consumer – in teleosemantic terms). 
Apart from literal cooking, cooking up word charades is usually even more fun. 
I also collect football jerseys, support Legia Warsaw & Everton F.C. and am supported by Fąfel the Bernese Mountain Dog.
